# Music Mania
Created by Lydia Jin in Unity with the theme of "music" in mind, this game features an interactive 3D platformer showcasing skills in object manipulation, scorekeeping, particle systems, and more.

# Game Description
After clicking "Play" on the main menu, you spawn as a capsule on 1 of 3 platforms containing 1 black square and 8 white squares. Hovering over the black square plays the entire clip assigned to that platform, while hovering over the white squares will play a randomly assigned short segment of the full clip. The aim of the game is to select the white tiles in the correct order for each of the 3 platforms. Correctly selected tiles will turn green; incorrectly selected tiles will turn red, forcing you to restart on that platform. Upon restarting, the tiles will revert back to white, but their clip assignments will not change (if the first clip is on the top right tile but you select an incorrect tile, the first clip will still be in the first right tile when you re-spawn). Each of the 3 platforms features a minute-long clip of a different piece of music. When you successfully complete a platform — when all 8 white tiles are green — celebratory particles will spawn from the middle of the platform. When all 3 platforms are completed, you win!

# Controls
To move the capsule forward/left/backward/right, use either W/A/S/D or the arrow keys. To jump, use the space bar. You may need to double jump to get to the next platform. To select a tile, make sure the capsule is on the tile, then click "E." To pause the game (which will also pause any music that is playing), click "Esc."

# Process
Though I don't have much experience in Unity, I'm very eager to learn. Previously, I have tried to remake Flappy Bird, but this was my first time working with a 3D space. Additionally, it was my first time materializing an idea from scratch, without an entire video tutorial to guide me. Initially, I was hoping to create a 2D platformer with a narrative element, but with the time constraint, I wanted to showcase my coding and program development more densely. Through (probably close to) a hundred different youtube tutorials and forum threads, I was able to implement almost everything I was hoping for in this game.
